A silly lightweight plugin doing nothing useful.

== Description ==

That's right... There are tens of thousands of plugins registered at wordpress.org. And probably hundreds of thousands more available just anywhere on the internet. Presumably all of them have a purpose. They do something useful or are otherwise not-worthless.

This plugin is different and therefor unique from all of them; It is not particularly useful to use this plugin. That doesn't mean you should not install this plugin. It does a few things right. And it'll probably make you smile.
The plugin has a little dashboard, that's not very useful.
It shows you regular notifications that aren't very useful - But try to make you smile...

And it's designed to be a bit of a joke.

As with any plugin - Look for the plugin through the installer in your dashboard and click Install. You can search for "Arnan" or "Worthless Plugin" to easily find it.
Or, if you want to do it manually unzip the file and put the resulting folder in the wp-content/plugins/ folder.
Then you go to the plugins page and activate the plugin.
